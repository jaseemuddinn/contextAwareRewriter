# AI-Powered Context-Aware Text Rewriting System Architecture

## System Overview

This application provides intelligent text rewriting capabilities that adapt to context, tone, and user preferences using AI models.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (Next.js React)

- **Main Interface**: Text input/output areas with real-time preview
- **Context Panel**: Configuration for writing style, tone, audience
- **History View**: Previous rewrites and comparisons
- **Settings**: API configuration and user preferences

### 2. AI Integration Layer

- **Primary**: AkashChat API with LLaMA model
- **Fallback**: Dummy data for development/testing
- **Context Analysis**: Text analysis for style, tone, and complexity
- **Prompt Engineering**: Dynamic prompt generation based on context

### 3. Core Features

- **Real-time Rewriting**: Live text transformation as user types
- **Multiple Modes**: Formal, casual, technical, creative, academic
- **Context Awareness**: Audience, purpose, and domain detection
- **Style Consistency**: Maintains user's writing patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple paragraph rewriting

### 4. Data Flow

```
User Input → Context Analysis → Prompt Generation → AI API → Post-processing → Output
     ↓
  Settings & Preferences → Local Storage → Session Management
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- **AI Integration**: AkashChat API (LLaMA model)
- **State Management**: React Context + localStorage
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Development**: ESLint, PostCSS

## Key Features

### Context Detection

- **Audience Analysis**: Professional, academic, casual
- **Purpose Detection**: Email, essay, report, social media
- **Tone Analysis**: Current text tone and desired output tone
- **Domain Recognition**: Technical, business, creative writing

### Rewriting Modes

1. **Formal**: Professional and structured language
2. **Casual**: Relaxed and conversational tone
3. **Technical**: Domain-specific terminology and precision
4. **Creative**: Engaging and expressive language
5. **Academic**: Scholarly and research-oriented
6. **Concise**: Shortened while maintaining meaning
7. **Elaborate**: Expanded with additional detail

### User Experience

- **Split-screen Interface**: Original text on left, rewritten on right
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant feedback as users type
- **Suggestion Highlighting**: Shows changes and improvements
- **Undo/Redo**: Full history of edits
- **Export Options**: Copy, download, or share results

## Security & Privacy

- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of user credentials
- **Data Privacy**: No text storage on servers (client-side only)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures

## Development Phases

1. Core UI and basic rewriting
2. Context analysis and multiple modes
3. Real-time features and advanced UI
4. Settings, persistence, and polish
